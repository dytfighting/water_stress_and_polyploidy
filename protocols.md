## Seed germination
The fiber seeds were delinted by acid wash (aka, acid delinting). Briefly, a small sample of seeds are soaked in sulfuric acid (dilution not required) in glass petri dish quickly, followed by three rinses in tab water. During acid wash, tiny bubbles form around seeds as fibers are dissolved in acid; the acid wash process is rather quick, only a few seconds (no longer than 30 seconds) depending on the amount of seeds and the fibers attached. Delinted seeds were dried with paper towel, chipped and placed on germination paper in petri dish at 28C. It seems important to keep germination paper moist, by add water twice a day. It usually takes 2-4 days for cotton seeds to germinate.
