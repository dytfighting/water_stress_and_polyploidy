## Seed germination
The fiber seeds were delinted by acid wash. Briefly, seeds were soaked in sulfuric acid for less than 30s, followed by washing with water for three times. Delinted seeds were dried with paper towel, chipped and placed on germination paper in petri dish at 28C. It seems important to keep germination paper moist, by add water twice a day. It usually takes 2-4 days for cotton seeds to germinate.
